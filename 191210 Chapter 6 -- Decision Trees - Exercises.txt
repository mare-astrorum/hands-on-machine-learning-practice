1. What is the approximate depth of a Decision Tree trained (without
restrictions) on a training set with one million instances?

log2(10^6) ~ 20

2. Is a node’s Gini impurity generally lower or greater than its parent’s? Is
it generally lower/greater, or always lower/greater?

generally lower

3. If a Decision Tree is overfitting the training set, is it a good idea to try decreasing max_depth?

yes

4. If a Decision Tree is underfitting the training set, is it a good idea to try
scaling the input features?

makes no difference


5. If it takes one hour to train a Decision Tree on a training set containing
1 million instances, roughly how much time will it take to train another
Decision Tree on a training set containing 10 million instances?

more than 10 h ==> 11.7 hrs


6. If your training set contains 100,000 instances, will setting
presort=True speed up training?

no, too many samples
